Notes on group meeting 2/26:
-Mingkai: compiling OpenCV. Reproducing SIFT features.
-Wanting: RGB, HSV, LBP.
-Kai: TensorFlow. Cross validation is already built into the model.
-Dan: working on Random Forests and researching old projects for how they did neural networks
-Toby: finished HOG features.

In train.R:
-one train function, with a bunch of parameters (TRUE/FALSE)
-each parameter determines whether to call an *individual* training function
-each classifier that we implement will have its own subfunction within "train"

In feature.R:
-this is more or lest finished!
-

What classifiers?
-GBM


How to finalize the code?

How does all the code fit together?
