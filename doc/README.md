# Project 1: 
### Doc folder

The doc contains the main.Rmd file which wraps all the function used in this project. 

The main.Rmd file following structure:

Load the direction: modify the location see the comments

Set the control TRUE or FALSE for each model used and feature extraction. Such as run.sift <- T means run sift feature extraction and F means not run this code. 

Construct visual features: features extraction is controlled by T of F for each feature extraction function. 

Train a classification model: model also is controlled by run.model <- T or F. Run one model each time. 

Make predictions: run the prediction, and the confusion matrix is used for testing

Summarize running time: calculate running time for training etc.
